# Horizon-web1
## Description
This project was undertaken as part of a coding bootcamp. This was the first challenge exercise and asked me to refactor sample code incorperating semantic elements, adding comments, and removing repetitions. This is a common problem for many websites to bring their code up to current standards. This project provided me practice using git to methodically change HTML and CSS code and track and commit changes to the code.
